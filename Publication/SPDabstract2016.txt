The \textit{MOSES} (\textit{Multi-Order Solar EUV Spectrograph})  sounding rocket was launched February 8th, 2006 to capture images of the sun at 304 \AA. The \textit{MOSES} concave grating forms solar images in multiple spectral orders, in an effort to measure line profiles from a single exposure over a wide field of view. We present a preliminary identification of spectral content in \textit{MOSES} images. The cross correlation of subtracted images provide evidence of spectral content besides the normal 304 \AA He II line. We place confidence on the peaks in correlation by cross correlating random data that is statistically representative of \textit{MOSES} data. These significant peaks indicate a contribution to intensity from several coronal lines.  These lines are individually weak, but if not taken into account, they would significantly increase the residuals when inverting \textit{MOSES} images to obtain spectra.
